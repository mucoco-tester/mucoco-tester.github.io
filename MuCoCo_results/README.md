# MuCoCo Experiment Results

This section contains results for MuCoCo experiments reported in the main report. Add the MuCoCo experiment results folder under this section like so ```MuCoCo_results/MuCoCo_experiment_results```. The experiment results had to be uploaded separately due to its size.

This sub-directory structure is as follows:

```markdown
project-root/MuCoCo_Results
├── README.md                          # this file
├── MuCoCo_experiment_results           # download the results separately and move the folder here
└── notebooks                           # Python notebooks for aggregating MuCoCo results
    ├── RQ1_results_aggregation.ipynb
    ├── RQ2_turbulence_mucoco_aggregation.ipynb
    ├── RQ3_confidence_aggregation.ipynb
    ├── RQ3_mutation_operators_aggregation.ipynb
    └── RQ4_results_aggregation.ipynb
```

Head to `notebooks` to run notebooks validating MuCoCo results.
